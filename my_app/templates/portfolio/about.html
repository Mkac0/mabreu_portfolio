                            As a dyslexic coder, reading and writing can take more effort — but that challenge gave me a superpower. When I recently started coding, I struggled with syntax and documentation. But over time, I noticed something: while others focused on every line, I was drawn to the bigger picture — how systems fit together, where logic breaks down, and how to simplify complexity.
                            Dyslexia trained me to see patterns, think spatially, and solve problems creatively. And those skills? I believe they’re gold in software development. Many dyslexic tech leaders — like Richard Branson and David Baszucki (creator of Roblox) — have said the same: dyslexia helped them think differently, focusing less on memorization and more on innovation.

                            I’ve been focused on full-stack projects using JavaScript, React, Node.js, SQL, and Python. I love turning ideas into real, working products—especially when I get to bridge the gap between technical solutions and real-world business needs.
                            I’m always looking to learn, grow, and connect with others who are passionate about tech, data, and problem-solving.
